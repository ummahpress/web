  "title": "Gaza Death Disparity: 10,000 Palestinians Under Rubble vs. One Israeli Recovered",
  "content": "Three reports today reveal Israel's staggering moral calculus in Gaza. While launching major military operations to recover a single soldier's body, 10,000 Palestinians remain trapped under rubble - unnamed, unclaimed. Meanwhile, despite announced ceasefires, attacks continue: 3 more Palestinians killed today in Gaza City. The total death toll now stands at 71,660 Palestinians dead with 171,419 injured since October 2023. This isn't just military asymmetry; it's a system that values Israeli life with forensic precision while treating Palestinian death as statistical collateral.",
  "takeaway": "Israel's Gaza campaign shows occupation's brutal math: forensic recovery for occupiers, mass graves for the occupied - proving even in death, Palestinians are denied basic dignity.",
